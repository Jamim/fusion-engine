Fusion is a free open-source game engine for creating graphical applications using the PySDL2 library and the programming language Python. It provides a simple coding interface for creating windows, rendering graphics, and handling user input. It is an engine to create games fast and easy!

## üìö This Website

We made this website only for the docs, and nothing more. Here you can find the docs for the Fusion Engine API. Please keep in mind Fusion Engine is unfinished.

## üìñ Wiki

Welcome to the Fusion Engine wiki!
Here you will find everything you need to start with Fusion Engine! For examples, you can find them on the example page, and for the API, look into the API page.
Because Fusion Engine is under development, this wiki won't be updated frequently, and some pages might be unfilled.

### üî© Features that maybe will be implemented

- [ ] UI (Using own GUI library)
  - [ ] Menu
  - [ ] Create project
  - [ ] Editor
  - [ ] Code editor build in
  - [ ] Run game

### üíª Using it for Your Project

To install it run this:

```bash
  pip install fusion-engine
```

Then import:

```python
  import fusionengine as engine
```

And after that you need to create a object of our engine to run functions of it:

```python
  main = engine.Main()
```
